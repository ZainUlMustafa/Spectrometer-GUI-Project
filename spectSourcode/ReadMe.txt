This GUI project works for Spectrometer designed by NUST and aims to get data from its sensors. This GUI first saves data  into a automatically created file then reads the same file and retrieves the info again, edits it and plot the required graph.

NOTE: This project isn't complete, I am currently working on it. This repository is shared here just to make it available to all team members of this project.

Currently the serial communication is built successfully. Filing and saving raw data into the received.txt is completed but will not perfectly work.
